# DESI Science Requirement verification for LRG Targets

**L2.2.1** The average density of successfully observed, galaxy clustering science-quality LRGs with redshift 0.4 < z < 1.0 shall be at least 300 per sq. deg (including BOSS LRGs over the BOSS area).

**L2.2.2** The random error on individual LRG redshifts in a ∼Gaussian core shall be less than σz = 0.0005(1 + z) (equivalent to 150 km/s rms).

**L2.2.3** Systematic inaccuracy in the mean LRG redshift shall be less than ∆z = 0.0002(1+ z) (equivalent to 60 km/s).

**L2.2.4** LRG redshift catastrophic failures exceeding 1000 km/s shall be < 5%.

**L2.2.5** The LRG redshift completeness shall be >95% for each pointing averaged over all targets that receive fibers.

**L2.8.1** The LRG target density shall be 350 per deg2, with at least 300 per deg2 successfully measured (§L2.2.1). With a fiber assignment efficiency of 99% for LRGs, this implies a combined target selection and redshift measurement efficiency of 87%. The magnitude limit for this sample is zAB < 20.56.
